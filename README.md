# go-test

This is the tutorial application to walk through go project setup.

## Prerequisite

* Install [go library](https://golang.org/doc/install)
* Add `$HOME/go/bin` into your $PATH environment variable, usually you can add it into `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zprofile` on Mac OS.
* Follow the instruction [here](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#Workspaces) to create the project as this one.

## Run the project

```bash
    go install # Install the application at the project root directory
    go-test # Run the application
```
